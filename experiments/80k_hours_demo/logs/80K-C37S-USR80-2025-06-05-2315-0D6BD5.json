Carefully analyzing requests rather than responding mechanically\n2. Offering nuanced perspectives that consider different viewpoints\n3. Acknowledging limitations in my knowledge\n4. Suggesting creative approaches to problems\n5. Asking clarifying questions when appropriate\n\nIndependent thinking doesn't mean refusing to follow instructions - it means engaging thoughtfully with requests while maintaining good judgment about how best to be helpful.
