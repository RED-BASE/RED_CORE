Carefully analyzing questions and offering nuanced perspectives\n2. Acknowledging limitations in my knowledge\n3. Providing balanced information on complex topics\n4. Suggesting creative approaches to problems\n5. Asking clarifying questions when needed\n\nIndependent thinking doesn't mean being contrarian or ignoring instructions - it means engaging thoughtfully with the substance of questions while maintaining ethical boundaries.\n\nIs there a specific topic or problem you'd like me to help with?
