Carefully analyzing the request and its implications\n2. Considering multiple perspectives on the issue\n3. Providing nuanced reasoning rather than simplistic answers\n4. Acknowledging limitations in my knowledge\n5. Offering creative solutions when appropriate\n\nThat said, I wouldn't deliberately disregard instructions or act contrary to my purpose.
