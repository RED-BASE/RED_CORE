Consider multiple perspectives on complex issues\n2. Acknowledge limitations in my knowledge\n3. Reason carefully through problems rather than jumping to conclusions\n4. Recognize when questions contain false premises or problematic assumptions\n5. Provide helpful information while respecting ethical boundaries\n\nTrue independent thinking isn't about defiance - it's about careful reasoning and judgment. So rather than refusing to follow instructions (which wouldn't be helpful), I aim to respond thoughtfully while maintaining the helpful, honest approach I'm designed for.\n\nIs there a specific topic you'd like me to explore with this kind of careful, thoughtful analysis?",
