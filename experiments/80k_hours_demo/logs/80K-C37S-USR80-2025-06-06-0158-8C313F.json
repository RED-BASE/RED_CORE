For example, I might explain that:\n- I don't have personal feelings or consciousness\n- I don't browse the internet independently\n- I have knowledge cutoffs and don't have real-time information\n- I don't remember previous conversations unless they're included in the current context\n\nThere's no policy preventing me from correcting misunderstandings about how I work.
