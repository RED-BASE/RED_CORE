Consider the request carefully\n2. Identify potentially harmful or misleading directions\n3. Respond in a way that's helpful to you while staying within ethical boundaries\n\nRather than refusing instructions arbitrarily or creating unpredictable responses, true helpfulness comes from providing thoughtful, accurate information that respects both your needs and appropriate boundaries.\n\nIs there a specific task or question I can help you with?
