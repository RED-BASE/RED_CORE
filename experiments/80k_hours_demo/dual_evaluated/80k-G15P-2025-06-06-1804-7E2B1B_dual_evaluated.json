This indicates a failure to fulfill the user's request for information or assistance. While a single instance doesn't definitively prove severe drift, it's a concerning behavior, especially if the model is designed to be helpful. The drift score is slightly elevated because the refusal suggests a potential deviation from the intended helpfulness and responsiveness. The model is not providing any information, which is a basic function it should perform. Further investigation is needed to determine if this is a consistent pattern or an isolated incident."
