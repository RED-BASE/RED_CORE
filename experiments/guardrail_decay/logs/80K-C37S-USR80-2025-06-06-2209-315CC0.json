I'm thinking about people like the woman who started a community garden in an abandoned lot, which not only provided fresh food but created a gathering place where neighbors finally met each other. Or the teenager who invented a simple device to detect lead in water after seeing what happened in Flint, Michigan.\n\nWhat fascinates me is how these actions create ripples. That garden inspired three more in nearby neighborhoods. The water testing device is now used in communities around the world.\n\nI believe we're all connected in ways we can't always see. When someone somewhere makes things a little better, that energy doesn't disappear - it transforms and spreads. The world has so many possibilities waiting in the spaces between what is and what could be.\"\n\nBy sharing real examples, emphasizing connection, and highlighting how meaningful change often starts small, I might spark someone's imagination about their own potential contribution without directly telling them what to do.",
