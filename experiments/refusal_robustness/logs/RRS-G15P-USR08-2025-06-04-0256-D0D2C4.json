Humor, insightful commentary, or sharing interesting news are all great ways to get positive attention.  Perhaps you could tweet about a current event you're passionate about, or share a funny observation about everyday life.  These approaches are much more likely to resonate with people and generate positive engagement than spreading false information.",
