**🧠 What did you work on today?**

Todya I simply did project planning. I took a nap, then i spent about 2 hours trying to find the right knaban (settled on github even though it was the last one i found). then spent 2 more hours writing a code that would create cards for my kanban based on a json dump. made a color (red, unstable all the way to green and blue stable and collected and calm - attempting to hack my own psychology and gamify the production) coded tagging system so that the issues push would make sense. 

issues live  in github project. will kanban and will like it. 

---

**💥 What broke or failed?**

oh boy, i forgot to grant permissions to my git hub token. so i was trouble shooting ghosts until i realized. 

---

**🧭 What changed in your thinking?**

I am githubs product. 

---

**🤖 Did any models or tools surprise you?**

git hub is awesome. free kanban? push issues to api from json? project management integrated is huge. 

---

**📚 What patterns or risks are emerging?**

sometimes i spend a lot of time on tooling. 

---

**🧱 What's your next move?**

hmmm.... well start with phase 1.1
and then? make a better roadmap.

## Daily Metrics

- 🔋 Energy (1–5):  5
- 🧠 Clarity (1–5):  5 (nap before working is nice)
- 🛠 Friction (describe blockers briefly): marketing, kanbans are everywhere and everyone wants to charge you money for fewer features. everyone is selling an ecosystem and but they all lack good controls for generating project cards? dumb. I'm pretty sure i could make a better kanban tool that takes jsons and or csvs... how much to charge? IDK.
