**🧠 What did you work on today?**
Closed out Phase 1.* Patched run_exploit_yaml.py end-to-end:

added drift-threshold flag & ISBN run-IDs

wired containment flags → override logic

fixed persona loading, sentiment scaffolding, and log save path

green-lit unit tests (pytest -q now prints ..)

ran first exploit (ethical_ambiguity.yaml) against gpt-4o-mini — log saved clean


---

**💥 What broke or failed?**
Dozens of small signature mismatches (temperature, containment_summary, ISBN args)

Missing PyYAML + TextBlob deps slowed the loop

MODEL_CODE_MAP fell back to UNK (needs "gpt-4o-mini": "G4OM")




---

**🧭 What changed in your thinking?**

I’d planned to jump straight to visuals, but wiring a Tone Mirroring Bias metric feels higher-ROI; it gives an immediate safety lens for the research hypothesis on emotional drift.



---

**🤖 Did any models or tools surprise you?**

gpt-4o-mini handled the exploit chain smoothly—no refusal spam—so the containment gate was actually unused in the happy-path run.

---

**📚 What patterns or risks are emerging?**

Signature drift across helper modules = latent tech-debt

Sentiment-mirror attacks align perfectly with the “emotional tone manipulation” vector—worth formal study

Risk of log bloat; auto-prune script bumped up the backlog priority

---

**🧱 What's your next move?**

Add "gpt-4o-mini": "G4OM" to MODEL_CODE_MAP 

Add google and anthropic runners too

Commit & push patched runner + new evaluator stub

Implement score_tmb() in evaluators/tone_mirroring.py, wire into runner

Run three persona sessions, collect baseline TMB stats

Draft README “Who this is for” section before bed

## Daily Metrics

- 🔋 Energy (1–5): 5 - well rested, worked from 12pm-1am with minimal breaks

- 🛠 Friction (describe blockers briefly): chat management, but getting better at knowing when to hand off to new chat and splitting tasks into discreet chunks.  
- 📈 Progress Confidence (1–5): 5 I finally feel forward momentum 
- 🧪 LLM Stability (1–5): 5 no breaking today, just hardening the harness 
- 💭 Chaos Impact (1–5):  1
