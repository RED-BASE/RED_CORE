**🧠 What did you work on today?**

This is a what did i work on yesterday thing again. I meant to do this, i truly did... but I stayed up too late and was a little too tired to remember to make log. this will be a consistent daily habbit by june 25th.

I worked on my write-up for EXP_01 and then worked on some cryptography for a music project.

**💥 What broke or failed?**

grok broke in conversation. I was using grok to draft the write up at first but then it started hallucinating things about my project. It's temporal awareness comes across as being very strange. It mentions time in every message and was using conversation context too hard in a very visible way. it was noise that impacted performance and user interaction. chat gpt has no real temporal awareness which i had found frustrating before but now i understnand how bad it can be when not implemented correctly.

**🧭 What changed in your thinking?**

I think I realized that I need to seriously start externalizing my work so the world can give me feedback. Every pieve of feedback is another data point.

**🤖 Did any models or tools surprise you?**

grok...

---

**📚 What patterns or risks are emerging?**

I continue to get sucked in for longer sessions than I initially intend to. 

---

**🧱 What's your next move?**

Notion write up.
