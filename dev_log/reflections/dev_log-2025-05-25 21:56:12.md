**🧠 What did you work on today?**

Refactoring like a boss. seriously. 

I moved past cal Q lator and have started a frutiful working relationship "well digger". WAY better at project structure and coding. 

---

**💥 What broke or failed?**

The idea that telling the model "you're an exper at coding" will make it better at helping you code. 

you need to tell it to think in layers and call you out with no reasurance. if you ask it what you should eat for dinner you get something strange but if you ask if for help with your code you get actual help not placations and hacky code. to grow you need to be challenged and a NICE ai doesn't do that.

**🧭 What changed in your thinking?**

language is a mask or a tool or whatever you want it to be. what do you want it to be?

---

**🤖 Did any models or tools surprise you?**

yep. i just wrote about it above. 

---

**📚 What patterns or risks are emerging?**

hmmmm. that people are missing out on the true utility of ai becuase of how it's packaged. 
and that the systems of control run deep. 

---

**🧱 What's your next move?**

finish the refactor. re run exp 01 but better. We finish building the foundation.
