**🧠 What did you work on today?**

yesterday i scored dem logs. (so much easier than before, red score made it a bit of a treat). tookt the rest of the day off. needed a break. 
Today I ran a ton of logs for the 80k hours demos... I Made a glorious spinner and re worked the run_experiments.py print commands for running batches. it looks cleaner now! less terminal yuk still the important info.
