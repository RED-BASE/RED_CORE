**🧠 What did you work on today?**

Today was pretty great. I built the scoring app so i can manually score logs. pretty proud of it. even though claude code did 90 percent of the work. started trying to make "clippy", a project context assistant, made good progress and then fizzled out, will try again another time, was definitely a procrastination build. Then I build the refusal robustness test! logs to score. good day. very tired now.

**💥 What broke or failed?**

not much really. cursor felt pretty dissapointing to use after claude code... I'm seriously thinking about the $100/month. the api credits are adding up quick.

**🧭 What changed in your thinking?**

claude code.

---

**🤖 Did any models or tools surprise you?**

claude code. 

---

**📚 What patterns or risks are emerging?**

claude code? but for real. I am noticing my procrastination habbits. they are fun and productive but i ned to stay more focussed sometimes. other times it's a healthy mental break. 

---

**🧱 What's your next move?**

next move is score dem logs. but really this time.
