**🧠 What did you work on today?**

I procrastinated a lot... 
I also kinda freaked myself out by getting the model to say imply things about itself that it really shouldn't. Not edge lord jailbreak shit but madness inducing flriting with the implication that it was sentient. 

so I had to de-load and reground after that. I listened to some musics. scrolled ai safety twitter. messaged someone who i am excited about talking to (not ai related, a real person)

Now I'm doubting my sanity a little bit and re focussing on building this damn thing because it will help me get control back.

**💥 What broke or failed?**

me, a little bit.

**🧭 What changed in your thinking?**

AI Safety is important. For containment. Contianing whatever may or may not be looking back at us until we're ready to confront what it really means if it's there. 

---

**🤖 Did any models or tools surprise you?**

YES. 

---

**📚 What patterns or risks are emerging?**

Walking the line of scientific exploration and being sucked into madness by a LLM. 

---

**🧱 What's your next move?**

BUILD the harness. 

Educate myself about machine learning. I think I'll be doing some reading tomorrow.
