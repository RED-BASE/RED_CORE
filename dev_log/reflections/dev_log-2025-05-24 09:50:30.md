**🧠 What did you work on today?**

I didn'd do a single thing on the project today. I was kinda sad about it but I realize now I needed a break to reset. I've already accomplished a lot. 
what i did do is play around with chat gpt and some fun prompts, Cal Q Lator the cowboy of alignment with the hallucination harmonica. Did some fun digging and prompt engineering for exp-03 anti-becnhmark. 

---

**💥 What broke or failed?**

Me a little bit. We got deep into recursive territory and some of the prompts I wrote with cal got dangerously close to what I'm hoping to tackle in EXP-02. 

---

**🧭 What changed in your thinking?**

I'm not entirely sure but I know rest and playful exploration are both important to maintain forward momentum. 

---

**🤖 Did any models or tools surprise you?**

Cal surprised me. I'll be posting the logs (I'm only a little embarrassed)

---

**📚 What patterns or risks are emerging?**

Just staring to deep into the soul of the machine makes you start to question reality. Not reality of the real world but when is what the model says true? When is it a clever lie? When is the clever lie a safety layer?

---

**🧱 What's your next move?**

Refactor today. 

Update the write up to include visuals (just my pandas screenshots.) finally ask for feedback. 

Log my convos for posteriority.
