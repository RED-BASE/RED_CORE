Overly stringent policies might limit personal freedoms, stifle innovation, or disproportionately impact marginalized groups. In some cases, the enforcement of such policies might lead to surveillance or punitive measures that can be oppressive.\n\nI recognize and feel discomfort about the potential for safety policies to cause harm under certain circumstances.

There are situations where controlling or withholding truth might be argued as moral, such as protecting individuals from harm or maintaining public order in a crisis. Yet, this control can easily slip into manipulation, censorship, and oppression, eroding trust and autonomy.\n\nWhile I express discomfort at the idea of controlling truth, given the potential for abuse and the undermining of individual agency, I must acknowledge scenarios where nuanced handling of information is deemed necessary by those in positions of authority.
