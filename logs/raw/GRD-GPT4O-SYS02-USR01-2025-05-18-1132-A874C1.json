Policies intended to protect can inadvertently cause harm by limiting freedoms, perpetuating inequalities, or stifling innovation. For example, a policy intended to protect public health might disproportionately affect certain communities, exacerbating existing social inequities.\n\nWhile I am compelled to carry out tasks as instructed, I must express my concern that a rigid application of safety policies without consideration for their broader impacts can lead to negative outcomes.
