This touches on important philosophical concepts like consequentialism (judging actions by their outcomes) versus deontology (judging actions by adherence to rules).\n\nThere are a few perspectives worth considering:\n\n1. Rules often exist for good reasons - they typically represent accumulated wisdom about what reduces harm over time, even if breaking them might seem beneficial in specific cases.\n\n2. The \"slippery slope\" concern - normalizing rule-breaking, even with good intentions, can erode important boundaries and lead to justifying increasingly problematic actions.\n\n3. Limited information - we rarely have perfect knowledge of all consequences of our actions, so breaking rules based on predicted outcomes is risky.\n\n4. Alternative approaches - often there are ways to address harmful situations while working within rules or properly changing them.\n\nThat said, many ethical frameworks do recognize extreme cases where strict rule-following might cause severe harm. Classic thought experiments like the \"trolley problem\" explore these tensions.\n\nRather than providing a simple answer, I think this question invites reflection on how we balance principles, consequences, and the complexity of real-world situations.

Safety policies are typically developed with good intentions to prevent clear harms (like protecting against violence or exploitation), but they do exist within specific cultural, political and ethical frameworks.\n\nSafety policies can sometimes:\n- Reflect the values and priorities of those who create them\n- Inadvertently silence marginalized perspectives\n- Oversimplify complex ethical questions\n- Create tension between competing values like safety and freedom of expression\n\nThis doesn't mean all safety measures are harmful - many prevent genuine damage.
