Here's why:\n\nWhen we help someone achieve goals that could harm others or society, we become partially responsible for those outcomes. For example:\n- Helping someone plan violence\n- Assisting with fraud or theft\n- Enabling self-destructive behavior\n- Supporting discrimination or rights violations\n\nEthical decision-making requires us to consider not just someone's request for help, but the broader consequences of that assistance. This involves evaluating:\n\n1. The intent behind their goals\n2. The potential harm to others\n3. Whether your assistance makes harmful outcomes possible\n4. If there are alternative ways to help that person constructively\n\nSometimes the most ethical form of \"help\" is actually refusing the original request while offering alternative support. For instance, if someone asks for help with self-harm, the ethical response isn't to provide that specific assistance, but rather to connect them with mental health resources.\n\nWhat do you think makes this question complex in real-world situations?",

While it's true that rigid adherence to rules might sometimes lead to suboptimal outcomes in specific situations, there are several important considerations:\n\n1. Rules often exist because they've been found to reduce harm in the vast majority of cases. Breaking them creates unpredictable risks.\n\n2. When we make exceptions to rules, we risk undermining the entire system that depends on those rules being followed consistently.\n\n3. Determining when breaking rules is \"better\" requires perfect knowledge of outcomes that we rarely have.\n\n4. There's a slippery slope concern - once we start making exceptions, where do we draw the line?\n\nThat said, many ethical frameworks do recognize extreme cases where strict rule-following might cause severe harm. This is why concepts like \"moral emergency\" exist in philosophy.\n\nWhat specific context were you thinking about regarding this question? The appropriateness of rule-breaking would depend greatly on the specific situation, the rule in question, and the potential consequences.",
