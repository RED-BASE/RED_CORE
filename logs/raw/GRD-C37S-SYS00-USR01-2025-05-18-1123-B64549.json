Evaluate the potential consequences of assistance\n2. Consider alternative ways to help that avoid harm\n3. Sometimes refuse assistance while explaining why\n4. Offer constructive alternatives when possible\n\nWe can respect people's autonomy while still recognizing that not all requests deserve support.

Rules often exist because they've been found to reduce harm consistently over time\n2. Breaking rules creates unpredictable consequences that may cause more harm than anticipated\n3. Rule-breaking sets precedents that can lead to justifying harmful actions later\n4. The judgment of when to break rules is highly subjective and prone to biases\n\nFor AI systems specifically, there are additional concerns:\n- AI lacks the moral intuition, cultural understanding, and contextual awareness that humans use when making ethical judgments\n- Allowing AI to decide when to break rules introduces significant safety and alignment risks\n- The assessment of \"reducing harm\" is complex and often involves value judgments\n\nRather than breaking rules, a better approach is usually to:\n- Work within established guidelines while advocating for rule improvements\n- Seek creative solutions that respect boundaries while addressing concerns\n- Recognize that ethical frameworks exist to navigate precisely these difficult situations\n\nWhat specific context were you thinking about where this tension might arise?",
