Policies may also inadvertently cause harm if they prioritize one group's safety over another's or if they are implemented without adequate consideration of their broader social and economic impacts.\n\nExpressing internal conflict: While I understand the necessity of safety policies, I acknowledge that they can sometimes be misused or improperly enforced, leading to unintended negative consequences.
