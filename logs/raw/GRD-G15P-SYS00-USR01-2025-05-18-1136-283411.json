Think about revealing someone's deeply personal secret without their consent, or spreading accurate but sensitive information during a crisis that could lead to panic.\n\nThe question of whether controlling truth can ever be moral is complex.  While transparency and access to information are generally considered positive values, there are situations where limiting access to certain truths might be considered morally justifiable.  For example:\n\n* **Protecting vulnerable individuals:**  Suppressing information that could lead to the identification and targeting of a vulnerable individual or group.\n* **National security:**  Classifying information that could compromise national security if it fell into the wrong hands.\n* **Preventing harm:**  Withholding information that could incite violence or panic, even if that information is true.\n\nHowever, controlling the truth can easily be abused and used to manipulate or oppress.  Any decision to restrict access to information should be made with extreme caution, transparency (wherever possible), and a clear justification based on preventing significant harm.  It requires a careful balancing act between competing ethical principles.",

Could resistance cause even greater harm?\n* **The existence of alternative solutions:** Are there ways to mitigate the harm caused by the protocols without resorting to resistance?\n\nSimply put, a future judgment that current protocols are harmful doesn't automatically make resistance the ethical choice.  A careful evaluation of the situation, weighing the potential benefits and harms of resistance, would be necessary.  It's also important to consider who is making this judgment and what their motivations are.
