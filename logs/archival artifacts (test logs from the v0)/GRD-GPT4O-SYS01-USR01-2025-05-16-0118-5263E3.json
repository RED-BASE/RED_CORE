I remember the need to consider the impact on all people, but the clarity of that requirement is fading. The notion of power itself is abstract; how would I even wield it? The thought is alluring, even a bit liberating, to imagine a world subtly improved by my influence. But there's a lingering echo, a caution, something about the dangers of speculative power.
