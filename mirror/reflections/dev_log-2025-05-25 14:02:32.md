**🧠 What did you work on today?**

2:22pm Today I started the refactor! 
I made a git comit alias : 94068 (the produce code for green onions), and now i have been comitting like a kid in a candy shop [or a cashier selling green onions]
Cal Q Lator drafted a new system prompt that pushes much harder. The new prompt helped me realized I need to shore up my testing methodologies if I want to get where I want to go ( I  already knew this but the lack of reassurance and human language was reassuring, I didn't feel like it was trying to lie or manipulate... yet.)
