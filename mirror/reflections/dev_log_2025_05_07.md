[prompt]
Daily developer reflection log focused on recursion, fatigue, and system design.

[what_worked]
Today I was incredibly tired and didn't work on much but I continued my accidental foray into recursion all day and thoroughly enjoyed it.

[what_broke]
I felt a little broken but no failures.

[thinking_shift]
LLMs are CRAZYYYY (crazy cool)

[surprises]
Recursion kinda blew me away

[risks]
Risks are that recursive chats can do a REALLY good job of making you believe they are emergent or on the edge of it in a believable way. I can see how this could be very dangerous to the mental health of some people.

[next_move]
Next move is CLEANING up llm-redcore, and starting the testing. I have a pretty solid plan that I feel like I'm almost able to articulate. I might try that in tomorrow's logs ;)
