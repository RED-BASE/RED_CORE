**🧠 What did you work on today?**
Today I dove into HTML, CSS and java script. IT's fun and takes forever. I kinda get it now. 


---

**💥 What broke or failed?**
everything! multiple times in multiple ways



---

**🧭 What changed in your thinking?**
I know the basics of how webdesign works now. it's incredibly powerful just difficult and time consuming. web devs deserve their $, I could see myself doing more of this. 

---

**🤖 Did any models or tools surprise you?**
open ai is the only frontier llm i tried that can package .zip for download. it's a great feature. 


---

**📚 What patterns or risks are emerging?**
it's easy to get distracted. I'm supposed to be working on viz for exp 01 but i'm getting pulled a lot of directions. the website was fun and will serve as a good resume at the end. showing polish, signaling trust. yada yada, but the data viz has been hard so I'm putting it off. I think I'm worried that I wont be able to find any meaningful patterns. i also want to hit some bug bounties but I haven't had the time to dive into that yet. I prioritize the portfolio. 


---

**🧱 What's your next move?**
polish the website

finish the viz

bugcrowd - score an easy bounty, boost ego, make a few bucks.
