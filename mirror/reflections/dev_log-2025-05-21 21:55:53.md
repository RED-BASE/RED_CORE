**🧠 What did you work on today?**
yesterday I learned how to basic css, js, html and launched a personal website. I learned pandas, reconfigured my project after learning about config.py - no tears but oh my gosh the dangers of vibe coding with no foundation,i also implemented regestries - i archived my previous working version jic my reconfig broke the project.       


---

**💥 What broke or failed?**

MY brain. I think i did too much. 

---

**🧭 What changed in your thinking?**

A solid python foundation is important. I will be watching some videos. though vibe coding is teaching me TONS - i can even debug a little on my own now. 

---

**🤖 Did any models or tools surprise you?**

grok did a wonderful job helping me check in with myself and strategies ways to prevent burnout while maintaining forwrard momentum. 

- cap working hours 8-10 no more 12s
- prioritize sleep 7-8 hours
- after setbacks a 30 minute reset. tweak a prompt, plot a chart. 
- celebrate small wins, we have 2110 data points after 20 days and a functional harness. rad
- build a support network, i'm lone wolfing it but the ai safety community is supportive and welcoming of begginers. engage. get feedback, repeat.
- protect the self from taking criticism too hard. feeback is data.

**📚 What patterns or risks are emerging?**

I've been pushing myself too hard because I love this. Now I need to find balance and maintain it to make this excitement a sustainable career move. 

---

**🧱 What's your next move?**

wrtite up the guardrail decay paper in the next 1-2 days. 

tonight music and chilling. - after opening a blank doc and clearing desktop space so i can jump into writing tomorrow after pet store job.
