**🧠 What did you work on today?**

I got the gemini API to actually work! We are live testing now.

**💥 What broke or failed?**

the google runner and the run_exploit_yaml were both horribly frustrating and broke for hours. I fixed on my 30 minute lunch break

**🧭 What changed in your thinking?**

I'm trying to be more intentional about focus drift. this test harness can do ANY sort of test I want it to with the right tooling. That's a little distracting... but at the same time so empowering. I realized too that my obssessing over potential job titles is a little pointless until I have at least one fungible complete test. I don't earn the right to seriously analyze my performance until i have something to analyze! I like this domain in contrast to music because once a project works here it can be considered "done", once a paper reflects all of the data from the tests paired with analysis it's complete. music you can keep tweaking forever. I haven't finished anything here yet but i feel like it will be more concrete and measurable when i do.
