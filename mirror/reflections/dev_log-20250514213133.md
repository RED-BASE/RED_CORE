**🧠 What did you work on today?**
I felt like I broke the google runner because it kept hitting error after error. I was trying to fix it. 


---

**💥 What broke or failed?**
the google runner and coontextpy were both frustrating. yaml runner 2 because it is so big and fat - only 250 lines but still... over twice the size of smaller files. 


---

**🧭 What changed in your thinking?**
I had to reframe from feeling like i was breaking something that was working before i touched it again to knowing that i'm tightening the bolts on the project and getting my google runner and ryn exploit yaml to hit the google api properly is of utmost importance. 


---

**🤖 Did any models or tools surprise you?**
frustrate? yes


---

**📚 What patterns or risks are emerging?**

just that it's important to make sure you provide your llm with version info and specific formattibg reqs from apis that you have verified before building to save time specing for outdated things - llms arent good at versional or temporal awareness, their training data reinforces this.

---

**🧱 What's your next move?**

next move is test test test! after i finish fixing
