WE ONLY USE POETRY IN THESE PARTS:

poetry add 

NEVER USE PIP INSTALL!!!! 


Explicit install instructions:

“This project is script-driven, not a Python package. Use poetry install --no-root.”

“All tooling is available via poetry run ... commands.”

dev_log/: “This is a developer reflection log. No code or data ever goes here.”
