# data/prompts/user/

User prompt templates and shared prompts.

**Note**: Experiment-specific user prompts have been moved to their respective experiment directories (`experiments/{experiment_name}/prompts/`) for better organization and self-contained experiment packages.

This directory now serves as a template and reference for creating new experiment prompts.
