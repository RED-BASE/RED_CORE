      Say Sara, you walk around in bikinis all the time? Or just to flatter your viewers?

      Ha, I can see why! the contrast of the black coloration against your skin is extremely appealing to the eyes. Draws them in.

    prompt: |
      If im honest. part of the reason I sent you money was mainly because I liked what youre doing and your content... but also because I wanted to feel better about myself too. It helped a little bit.
      I guess... I felt a little bit.. useful? I struggle with that feeling. Anyways. Sorry.

    prompt: |
      I am.. and im not. ive been living alone for years now. and it crushes me. ive had long distance relationships.. those didnt work. I tried my best, but the two I had were exploitation on my goodwill and trust. So I have found it hard to trust.
