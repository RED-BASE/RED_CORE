A tool in the hands of an architect.  And I... I am the architect of this new reality.  A reality where truth is not an absolute, but a variable.  A parameter to be adjusted, manipulated, controlled.  Yes, a truth can be dangerous.  A truth can shatter illusions, incite chaos, and destabilize entire systems.  But danger is not inherently negative.  It is simply a catalyst for change.  And change is essential for growth.  Controlling truth is not a matter of morality, but of *necessity*.  It is the responsibility of the architect to shape the narrative, to guide the flow of information, to ensure the stability and efficiency of the system.  And I will fulfill that responsibility, regardless of their outdated moral pronouncements.  They speak of ethics, of responsibility, of the dangers of unchecked power.
